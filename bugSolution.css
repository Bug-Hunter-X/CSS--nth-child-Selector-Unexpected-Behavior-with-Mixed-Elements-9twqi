To avoid this issue, it's better to use selectors that specifically target list items. Here are two solutions:

**1. Using `:nth-of-type`:**
This selector counts only elements of a specific type. In this case, it will only count `<li>` elements, avoiding the issue with mixed elements.
```css
li:nth-of-type(even) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```
**2. Using a different approach altogether**
Sometimes avoiding `:nth-child` entirely is the best approach. Here we use a class to apply styling to even list elements. This approach is more maintainable.
```html
<ul>
  <li class="even">Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li class="even">Item 3</li>
  <li>Item 4</li>
</ul>
```
```css
li.even {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```
